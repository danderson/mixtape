# Mixtape

Backup software for tape users with lots of WORM data. [Draft
design](DESIGN.md)

## License

This codebase is _not_ open-source software (or free, or "libre") at
this time. It is licensed under the [Anti-capitalist software
license](LICENSE), which places restrictions on who can use the
software.

## Contributing

This project is source-available but closed to code contributions at
this time. This is in part because I don't want to deal with PRs and
arguing over features, and in part so that I retain the freedom to
relicense in future.

Bug reports and feature requests filed at github issues are welcome.
